# MRM-NetworkMerger
merging two (macroscopic) and (microscopic) networks in one-layer network for DLSim
"Multi-resolution Modelling Network Merger" (MRM-NetworkMerger) is an open source package which users can merge two (macroscopic) and (microscopic) networks in one-layer network for DLSim-MRM. MRM-NetworkMerger uses [General Modeling Network Specification (GMNS)](https://github.com/zephyr-data-specs/GMNS) format for own its operations. Figure 1. shows the concept of the package, as follows:
